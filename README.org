#+TITLE: THERMOS importer

Can create a runnable jar file with "boot build"

That has a main method in https://github.com/cse-bristol/110-thermos-importer/blob/master/src/thermos_importer/core.clj

Things you can do at the moment will be like

java -jar WHEREVER.jar connect some-road-data.shp some-building-data.shp road-bits.json buildings-with-data.json

Roads and buildings might need to be in 4326, certainly need to be the same?

is the stuff about which fields from the input shapefile go into the output geojson.
